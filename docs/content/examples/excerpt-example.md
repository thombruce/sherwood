# Custom Excerpts in Sherwood

This post demonstrates how to use custom excerpts in Sherwood frontmatter. The excerpt above will be displayed in blog listings and other content summaries.

## Benefits of Custom Excerpts

1. **Control**: You have full control over what appears in listings
2. **SEO**: Craft perfect meta descriptions for search engines  
3. **Marketing**: Write compelling summaries to attract readers
4. **Context**: Provide specific context that might not be in the first paragraph

## Auto-Extraction

If you omit the `excerpt` field, Sherwood automatically extracts the first paragraph from your content and strips all formatting to create a plain text excerpt. This provides a sensible default behavior while giving you the option to override when needed.

## Best Practices

- Keep excerpts concise (ideally under 150 characters)
- Focus on the value proposition of your content
- Use active voice and engaging language
- Ensure excerpts accurately represent the full content

The excerpt field gives you precise control over how your content appears in generated site listings and search results.
